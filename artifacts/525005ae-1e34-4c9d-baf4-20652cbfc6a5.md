<h2>User Stories</h2>
<p>
As a data analyst, I want to view an advanced analytics dashboard so that I can gain insights into user behavior and trends.<br>
Acceptance Criteria: 
<ul>
<li>The dashboard displays key metrics in a visual format (charts, graphs).</li>
<li>Users can filter data by date range, user demographics, and specific actions.</li>
<li>The dashboard updates in real-time with the latest data.</li>
</ul>
As a security administrator, I need to implement OAuth 2.0 and JWT token management so that our users can securely authenticate.<br>
Acceptance Criteria: 
<ul>
<li>Users can authenticate through third-party providers using OAuth 2.0.</li>
<li>JWT tokens are generated upon successful authentication and are validated for each secure request.</li>
</ul>
As a developer, I want to ensure that all unit tests have a coverage of over 80% to maintain code quality.<br>
Acceptance Criteria: 
<ul>
<li>The test coverage report must be available in the CI/CD pipeline.</li>
<li>All newly developed features must have associated unit tests that contribute to the overall coverage.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Section 2: Functional Requirements -->
<section id="sec_2" class="prd-section technical-writer-agent" data-keywords="security,oauth,jwt,authentication">
<h2>Functional Requirements</h2>
<p>
1. The advanced analytics dashboard must fetch data from the backend API and present it in various formats (line charts, bar graphs, etc.).<br>
2. Users should log in using OAuth 2.0 and receive a JWT token for session management.<br>
3. The application must include a caching layer to enhance performance by storing frequently accessed data.<br>
4. The application must allow real-time collaboration through WebSocket integration, enabling users to see changes as they happen.<br>
5. Unit tests are required for all new code, and the coverage must be tracked at all times. The system should alert developers if coverage falls below 80%.<br>
6. The system will adopt a containerization approach using Docker and Kubernetes for consistent deployment environments.
</p>

<!-- Section 3: Non-Functional Requirements -->
<section id="sec_3" class="prd-section technical-writer-agent" data-keywords="performance,caching,database,optimization">
<h2>Non-Functional Requirements</h2>
<p>
1. The analytics dashboard should load within 3 seconds for optimal user experience.<br>
2. The application must handle at least 200 concurrent users without performance degradation.<br>
3. Security features must adhere to the latest standards, ensuring data encryption during authentication.<br>
4. The caching layer must reduce the number of database hits by at least 30% during peak load.<br>
5. The application must be scalable to accommodate future growth without requiring significant rework on the existing architecture.
</p>

<!-- Section 4: Technical Specifications -->
<section id="sec_4" class="prd-section technical-writer-agent" data-keywords="deployment,docker,kubernetes,containerization">
<h2>Technical Specifications</h2>
<p>
1. Use React for the frontend to develop the advanced analytics dashboard with D3.js for data visualization.<br>
2. Implement a Node.js backend to provide a RESTful API for data retrieval and processing.<br>
3. Utilize OAuth 2.0 for user authentication, integrating with popular providers such as Google and Facebook.<br>
4. WebSocket will be used for real-time data updates for collaboration features.<br>
5. Apply Redis in-memory store for caching frequently accessed analytics data.<br>
6. Use Docker to containerize application services and Kubernetes for orchestration and orchestration management.
</p>
</section>

<!-- Section 5: Acceptance Criteria -->
<section id="sec_5" class="prd-section technical-writer-agent" data-keywords="testing,unit-tests,coverage,quality">
<h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>
<p>
1. The advanced analytics dashboard must be deployed successfully and accessible without errors.<br>
2. A dynamic visual representation of data should be present and interactable.<br>
3. OAuth 2.0 authentication must be tested with dummy users and provide valid JWT tokens for access.<br>
4. Performance under load (200 users) should be validated through stress testing.<br>
5. Unit tests must be run as part of the CI/CD process with a report generated demonstrating at least 80% coverage.<br>
6. Users must be able to collaborate in real-time, viewing updates made by others instantaneously without needing to refresh.
